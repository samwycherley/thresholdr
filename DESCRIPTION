Description: This package provides a wrapper for the 'Julia' package 'ThresholdStability.jl', 
    available at <https://github.com/samwycherley/ThresholdStability.jl>, which provides methods for determining the stability of
    threshold vector autoregressive models, and for putting CKSVAR models into threshold vector autoregressive form.
